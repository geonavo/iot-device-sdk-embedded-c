roots.pem is a copy of the DigiCert TLS ECC P384 Root G5 certificate (https://cacerts.digicert.com/DigiCertTLSECCP384RootG5.crt.pem).

The ClearBlade IoT Core environments leverage DigiCert root certificates for SSL/TLS termination (see here for [ClearBlade docs on targeting devices](https://clearblade.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IC/pages/2210299905/Targeting+devices#Root-CA)).
